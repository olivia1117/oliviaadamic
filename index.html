<h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> Hi, my name is Olivia Adamic and I am currently a freshman in college starting my journey to a degree in computer science. I have been learning how to code for about 3 years
      since starting as a sophomore in high school through an online program called The Coding School. My main language is Python and I am so grateful to have had many wondeful
      mentors to teach me and guide me toward a path in tech even though I would have never considered it at a point in my life. I love to learn new things and have various interests
      aside from computer science such as playing piano and guitar, reading, kniting, crocheting, writing, tennis, gardening, and many others. </p>
