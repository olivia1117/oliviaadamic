        <h5>First Post!, Feb 12, 2022</h5>
          <p>Hello! This is my first post on my blog! I'm using this space to keep a record of all my progress I'm making in computer science and programming. 
          I was inspired to start documenting my journey because of various tech YouTubers I've watched. Most of them recommended that I should create a 
          person website and have a place to link my projects, talk a bit about myself, and even make short blog posts like this one. While many of them
          suggested starting off by using WordPress or SquareSpace to create a website, I wanted to try and learn about web design and development on my
          own a bit. So far, I haven't had much experience in HTML, CSS, and JS, but I plan to keep challenging myself to learn by doing as one of my 
          professors always recommends. Anyway, I hope you find my website interesting and maybe can take some inspiration from it as well!</p>

        <h5> Summer Plans, Mar 19, 2022</h5>
          <p>As of right now, I am about half-way done with my second semester at college and it has been a very busy and productive week. 
          Over spring break I decided to apply to become a mentor with The Coding School through their codeConnects program. It will be for
          about 12 weeks during the summer where I will get paired up with a student to teach them the basics of coding with Python. I really
          wanted to have something on my resume for future internships and computer science opportunities and I thought that this would be a 
          great way to get started since I have been mentored through their program as well when I was in high school. Through The Coding School
          I learned Python and also was able to branch out into a data science project as well. All of the mentors I worked with were amazing
          and super encouraging. I still keep in touch with some of them today and I now want to try and give back and be that person for a
          student thinking about pursuing computer science! I had an interview during my break and I got an email back a few days ago saying
          that I have been accepted to mentor this summer! I'm very interested to see if it will be a good fit for me because I enjoy helping
          others learn new things and I hope that this will be yet another positive experience in programming so far!
          <br>

          Some of my other plans for the summer other than mentoring include working on this personal website and learning more about web
          development. I like the idea of building something from the ground up and learning new things during the process despite the 
          temptation of using a drag and drop platform to develop a site for my work. I also have signed up to help with early voting in my
          area and I'm looking forward to adding that experience as well and getting to see the voting process in a different way. Finally,
          I plan to take a summer class at my community college and try to get another gen ed out of the way. It'll be a productive summer
          for sure!</p>
