  <h2> About This Website </h2>
  <p> This site is something that I am challenging myself to build from scratch as much as possible. I want to be able to have a digital portfolio of my work that I can 
      easily share while also learn something in the process. I am more proficient in Python than any other programming language, so hopefully building this site helps me to
      expand to other languages such as html, css, javascript, or jekyll. This is a place dedicated for my learning and improvement." </p>
