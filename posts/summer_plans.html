<p>As of right now, I am about half-way done with my second semester at college and it has been a very busy and productive week. 
  Over spring break I decided to apply to become a mentor with The Coding School through their codeConnects program. It will be for
  about 12 weeks during the summer where I will get paired up with a student to teach them the basics of coding with Python. I really
  wanted to have something on my resume for future internships and computer science opportunities and I thought that this would be a 
  great way to get started since I have been mentored through their program as well when I was in high school. Through The Coding School
  I learned Python and also was able to branch out into a data science project as well. All of the mentors I worked with were amazing
  and super encouraging. I still keep in touch with some of them today and I now want to try and give back and be that person for a
  student thinking about pursuing computer science! I had an interview during my break and I got an email back a few days ago saying
  that I have been accepted to mentor this summer! I'm very interested to see if it will be a good fit for me because I enjoy helping
  others learn new things and I hope that this will be yet another positive experience in programming so far!
  
  Some of my other plans for the summer other than mentoring include working on this personal website and learning more about web
  development. I like the idea of building something from the ground up and learning new things during the process despite the 
  temptation of using a drag and drop platform to develop a site for my work. I also have signed up to help with early voting in my
  area and I'm looking forward to adding that experience as well and getting to see the voting process in a different way. Finally,
  I plan to take a summer class at my community college and try to get another gen ed out of the way. It'll be a productive summer
  for sure!
